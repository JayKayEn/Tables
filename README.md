# Tables

A simple way to selectively view and interact with the feeds of only the users you wish to.
 
## Notice

This project was originally abandoned due to changes in the allowed scope of Instagram's API for non-verified brands/orgranizations, which prevented the app from reaching its full goal of providing users the ability to like or respond to recent posts of the users the follow. Recently (http://developers.instagram.com/post/133424514006/instagram-platform-update), there was a Sandboxed Mode introduced that could provide full access to publically-available API endpoints prior to having the app reviewed. After investigating what this Sandboxed Mode allows, this project may be resumed.
